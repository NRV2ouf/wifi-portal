# 🛜 Nomoshpere wifi connection automation

## Overview

This project aims at authenticate oneself to the [nomosphere wifi portal](https://controller.access.network/101/portal/) automatically instead of using a web browser.
It works by directly using the portal's API rather than the user interface.

## Installation and setup - 🪟 Windows

### 🧰 Installing the required tools 

 - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) if not already installed.
 - Open a terminal, navigate to the desired location and clone the project.
    - `git clone https://github.com/NRV2ouf/wifi-portal.git`
    - __Note:__ Do not remove this folder nor its content at the end of the installation
 - To install the javascript dependencies, run `npm install -g pkg`.

### 🛠️ Building the executable 

 - Use the following command will compile the javascript into a windows exectuable application: `pkg --target node18 .\main.js`
    - This executable should remain here as it needs some files in this folder.

### ⚙️ Setting up your credentials 

 - From the file `config.example.json`, create a similare file names `config.json`.
 - In this file, enter your credentials in the corresponding fields.

### ⚡Creating shortcuts 

 - Finally, you want this program to be easy to run. There are two places in which you to create shortcuts for it:

    1. On your __Desktop__. If you ever get disconnected you need to be able to reconnect easily
    2. In your __Start-up Folder__. This one is probably the most intersting one. Indeed, when your computer starts up, it looks in this folder and run every programs it finds. So placing a shortcut here would mean connecting to the wifi on start up.

   - To create both of these shortcuts at once, use `.\create_shortcuts.bat`

## Installation and setup - 🐧 Linux

 - You're using linux, I'm sure you'll manage to adapt what's above ;D

## Installation and setup - 🍎 macOS

 - TODO ?
 - Same as Linux (mostly 🙄)

## Misc

### 🪛 Troubleshooting

 - If you have a anti-virus, it may block the request using the credentials. If it happens, it should give you the option of white listing this endpoint. 
 - If the program doesn't manage to retreive the credentials, check the file `config.json` at the root of the project and check its integrity. See the _Setting up your credentials_ section.
 - If the authenticate fails, check the credentials you set in the file `config.json` at the root of the project.

### 🔒 Safety

Remember to always be carefull when manipulating you credentials. 
A good practice would be not to enter them in a stranger's program without any precautions.
It's an open-source, therefore, I recommend you try and read the source code to understand what's done with it.

### 🔨 Developement process

When logging in using a web browser, you can see the network traffic caused by the active page.
Using this you're able to see and `copy as fetch` the request that picked your interest. 
Doing this, you can see which are usefull and which one are not.

Once you get the mandatory requests, it's only a matter of programing to create a proper that will exploit it.

### 📃 Legal issue

This project is using the __MIT Liscence__. In other words, I am not responsible for anything that you might do with it.

### 😄 Enjoy

Now you're all set up. Enjoy winning 30 secondes everyday, hopefully, it will be worth the couple of hours I spent making this... 🫠
